# AI Training Data - Actionable Requirements

## Overview
This repository contains a structured breakdown of actionable requirements for AI training data management. The document focuses on key challenges faced by AI developers using web scraping for dataset generation, ensuring:

- **Categorization of training questions and answers separately**
- **Balanced and unbiased datasets**
- **Privacy, content safety, and monitoring AI performance**

## How to Use
1. Read through the **Actionable Requirements** under GitHub issues.
2. Use **sub-issues** to break down tasks and track progress.
3. Set up the **database schema** to manage training data and scraped content.
4. Implement **APIs** for bias detection, anonymization, and moderation tools.
5. Build a **UI dashboard** to monitor model performance and user feedback.
6. Integrate **NLP models** (e.g., spaCy, BERT) for bias and privacy checks.
