# Structured AI Data Framework â€“ User Stories & Implementation Guide

## [UR-01] Structured Training Data Framework

**User Story:**  
As a developer, I want to implement a structured training data framework so that I can categorize and retrieve data efficiently.

**Purpose:**  
After talking to the client, they expressed the need for structured and easily accessible training data. They find it difficult to work with unorganized datasets, which affects AI training performance. The decision was made to build a framework using a relational database (e.g., IBM Db2) to separate and categorize training questions from answers.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Use IBM Db2 as the database management system.
- Store training questions and answers separately.
- Implement efficient retrieval queries.

### ðŸ”´ Priority: High

### Sub-Issues

#### [UR-01.1] Create a Table for Training Questions
- **Assumption:** Structured training questions improve retrieval efficiency.
- **Validation:** Verify that the training questions table is created and can store sample data.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create a table with `question_id`, `question_text`, `category`, `created_at`.
  - Set `question_id` as the primary key.
  - Execute SQL script and verify the table structure.

#### [UR-01.2] Create a Table for Training Answers
- **Assumption:** Answers should be linked to their respective questions.
- **Validation:** Ensure a JOIN query can retrieve the correct answers for questions.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create a table with `answer_id`, `question_id`, `answer_text`, `created_at`.
  - Set `question_id` as a foreign key referencing `training_questions`.
  - Verify relationships with sample queries.

#### [UR-01.3] Implement SQL Queries for Retrieval
- **Assumption:** Developers need quick access to categorized questions and answers.
- **Validation:** Ensure queries return accurate results in minimal time.
- **Tasks:**
  - Write SQL queries to fetch categorized questions and answers.
  - Optimize queries for performance.
  - Validate results with test data.

## [UR-02] Bias-Checking Tool

**User Story:**  
As a developer, I want to build a tool that checks for bias in training data so that my AI models can be fair.

**Purpose:**  
The client noticed that AI models sometimes behave unfairly because of biased training data. To solve this, weâ€™ll create a tool that checks training data and shows where the bias is.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Use well-known datasets like WinoBias, SQuAD-Fairness, and CrowS-Pairs.
- Build a machine learning model to detect and highlight biased content.

### ðŸŸ  Priority: Medium

### Sub-Issues

#### [UR-02.1] Collect and Preprocess Bias-Detection Datasets
- **Assumption:** Cleaning and organizing the data will help the model work better.
- **Validation:** Make sure the data is in the correct format.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Download datasets (WinoBias, SQuAD-Fairness, CrowS-Pairs).
  2. Convert them into a clean and readable format.
  3. Preprocess the data (e.g., remove errors, normalize text).

#### [UR-02.2] Implement Bias-Detection Algorithm
- **Assumption:** AI models can find bias in written text.
- **Validation:** Measure the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Choose a machine learning model (like an NLP model).
  2. Train it using the cleaned bias datasets.
  3. Write code to detect and score how biased each sentence or word is.

#### [UR-02.3] Develop an API for Bias-Checking
- **Assumption:** The API should take in text and return bias analysis results.
- **Validation:** Make sure the results are correct and fast.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Build an API that accepts user input (text) for checking.
  2. Connect the API to the trained bias-detection model.
  3. Make sure the API responds quickly and accurately.

## [UR-03] AI Model Performance Monitoring

**User Story:**  
As a developer, I want to monitor AI model performance so that I can ensure accuracy and efficiency.

**Purpose:**  
After talking to the client, they expressed concern that AI models degrade in accuracy over time. To solve this, we will implement an automated performance monitoring system that tracks model efficiency.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Implement alerts and reporting tools for performance degradation.

### Sub-Issues

#### [UR-03.1] Define Performance Metrics
- **Assumption:** We can measure how well the AI is working using values like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Validation:** Make sure we are correctly tracking these values from the model.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Decide which performance metrics are important (e.g., accuracy, speed, etc.).
  2. Set up tracking for model accuracy and latency.

#### [UR-03.2] Develop a Real-Time Performance Dashboard
- **Assumption:** Having a visual dashboard will make it easier to monitor how the AI is performing over time.
- **Validation:** Make sure the dashboard shows live and accurate data.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Design a simple and clear dashboard interface.
  2. Connect the dashboard to the backend system so it shows real-time performance data.

## [UR-04] Data Anonymization Tool

**User Story:**  
As a developer, I want to build a tool that hides personal information in data so user privacy is protected.

**Purpose:**  
The client is concerned about privacy when using AI training data. So, we will build a tool that finds and removes personal details (like names, emails, addresses) from the data.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect personal information.
- Automatically remove or hide sensitive data using smart algorithms.
