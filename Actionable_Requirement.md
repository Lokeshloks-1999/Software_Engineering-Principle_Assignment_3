# Structured AI Data Framework â€“ User Stories & Implementation Guide

## [UR-01] Structured Training Data Framework

**User Story:**  
As a developer, I want to implement a structured training data framework so that I can categorize and retrieve data efficiently.

**Purpose:**  
After talking to the client, they expressed the need for structured and easily accessible training data. They find it difficult to work with unorganized datasets, which affects AI training performance. The decision was made to build a framework using a relational database (e.g., IBM Db2) to separate and categorize training questions from answers.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Use IBM Db2 as the database management system.
- Store training questions and answers separately.
- Implement efficient retrieval queries.

  [] Write code to detect and score how biased each sentence or word is.

#### [UR-02.3] Develop an API for Bias-Checking
- **Assumption:** The API should take in text and return bias analysis results.
- **Validation:** Make sure the results are correct and fast.
- **Tasks:**

## [UR-03] AI Model Performance Monitoring

**User Story:**  
As a developer, I want to monitor AI model performance so that I can ensure accuracy and efficiency.

**Purpose:**  
After talking to the client, they expressed concern that AI models degrade in accuracy over time. To solve this, we will implement an automated performance monitoring system that tracks model efficiency.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Implement alerts and reporting tools for performance degradation.

### Sub-Issues

#### [UR-03.1] Define Performance Metrics
- **Assumption:** We can measure how well the AI is working using values like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Validation:** Make sure we are correctly tracking these values from the model.
- **Tasks:**
  [] Decide which performance metrics are important (e.g., accuracy, speed, etc.).
  [] Set up tracking for model accuracy and latency.

#### [UR-03.2] Develop a Real-Time Performance Dashboard
- **Assumption:** Having a visual dashboard will make it easier to monitor how the AI is performing over time.
- **Validation:** Make sure the dashboard shows live and accurate data.
- **Tasks:**
  [] Design a simple and clear dashboard interface.
  [] Connect the dashboard to the backend system so it shows real-time performance data.

## [UR-04] Data Anonymization Tool

**User Story:**  
As a developer, I want to build a tool that hides personal information in data so user privacy is protected.

**Purpose:**  
The client is concerned about privacy when using AI training data. So, we will build a tool that finds and removes personal details (like names, emails, addresses) from the data.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect personal information.
- Automatically remove or hide sensitive data using smart algorithms.

### ðŸ”´ Priority: High

### Sub-Issues

#### [UR-04.1] Identify Sensitive Data in Training Sets
- **Assumption:** AI training data should not include personal info.
- **Validation:** Make sure the tool can correctly find personal details.
- **Tasks:**
  [] Make a list of sensitive data types (like names, phone numbers, emails, etc.).
  [] Train a model to detect these personal details in text.

#### [UR-04.2] Implement Anonymization Algorithm
- **Assumption:** The tool should protect privacy without making the data useless.
- **Validation:** Make sure the data is still useful after anonymization.
- **Tasks:**
  [] Use text-masking methods (like replacing names with "[NAME]").
  [] Test the tool using example datasets to check if it works well.

## [UR-05] Detecting and Handling Inappropriate Content

**User Story:**  
As a developer, I want to detect and handle inappropriate or sensitive content so the AI can behave in a safe and responsible way.

**Purpose:**  
The client is worried that the AI might generate or respond to harmful or inappropriate messages. To prevent this, we will build a content moderation system that can detect and stop such content before it reaches or is processed by the AI.
