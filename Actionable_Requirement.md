## [UR-01] Structured Training Data Framework

**User Story:**  
As a developer, I want to implement a structured training data framework so that I can categorize and retrieve data efficiently.

**Purpose:**  
After talking to the client, they expressed the need for structured and easily accessible training data. They find it difficult to work with unorganized datasets, which affects AI training performance. The decision was made to build a framework using a relational database (e.g., IBM Db2) to separate and categorize training questions from answers.
